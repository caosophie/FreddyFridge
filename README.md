## :avocado: Inspiration

A study made from the waste advisory body WRAP reveals that 40% of the bagged salad bought in the UK ends up in the waste. To combat food waste, we wanted to create an app that helps users avoid food forgotten at the back of their fridge and to be more sustainable. We also wanted to implement a platform that gives users access to their fridge whenever they are-- so no more buying items they already have!

## :hot_pepper: What it Does

**FreddyFridge** is an app that allows users to store their grocery items in a 'virtual fridge'. The app helps prevent food waste by letting the user keep track of the food. It also stores data associated with each of the item, mainly the expiry date; this allows the user to be notified when that date is approaching. When an item becomes expired, a prompt appears that informs the user of the longevity of the item past its best before date--the user can then choose between discarding and keeping the item. In addition, the user can maintain their grocery list on the app.
